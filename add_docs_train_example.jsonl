It uses modern JavaScript features such as ES modules and async/await. The project also utilizes several libraries, including `sade` for command-line interface creation, `strip-json-comments` for handling JSON with comments, and `yoctocolors` for colored console output. Additionally, it includes TypeScript typings and is structured to support both CLI and Node.js API usage."}
{"instruction":"Describe the initial steps the `resumed` CLI takes when it's launched, before processing any specific command.","input":"","output":"When the `resumed` CLI is launched, it performs the following initial steps:\n\n1. **Import Dependencies**: It imports necessary modules such as `readFile` and `writeFile` from `node:fs/promises`, `sade` for command-line interface creation, `stripJsonComments` for handling JSON with comments, and color utilities from `yoctocolors`.\n\n2. **Load Package Information**: It reads the package information from `package.json` using `readFile` to get the name and version of the package.\n\n3. **Initialize CLI**: It initializes the CLI using `sade` with the package name and version.\n\nThese steps set up the environment and prepare the CLI for processing specific commands."}
{"instruction":"What library is responsible for parsing the command-line arguments like commands (render, init, validate) and options (--theme, --output) in `resumed`, and how does it work?","input":"","output":"The library responsible for parsing the command-line arguments in `resumed` is `sade`. It is used in the `resumed/src/cli.ts` file.\n\n### How it works:\n\n- `sade` is initialized with the package name and version using `sade(pkg.name).version(pkg.version)`.\n- Commands are defined using the `.command()` method, where you specify the command name, description, and options.\n- Options for each command are added using the `.option()` method.\n- The `.action()` method is used to define the function that will be executed when the command is called.\n- The `cli.parse()` method is used to parse the command-line arguments and execute the corresponding command action."}
{"instruction":"Explain the complete sequence of actions performed by `resumed` when executing the `resumed init` command with no filename specified.","input":"","output":"When executing the `resumed init` command with no filename specified, the following sequence of actions is performed:\n\n1. **Command Parsing**: The `cli.ts` file uses the `sade` library to parse the command. The `init` command is recognized, and since no filename is specified, it defaults to `resume.json`.\n\n2. **Action Execution**: The `init` command triggers the `action` function associated with it. This function calls the `init` function from `init.ts` with the default filename `resume.json`.\n\n3. **Sample Resume Creation**: In `init.ts`, the `init` function uses `createRequire` to import a sample resume JSON from `@jsonresume/schema/sample.resume.json`.\n\n4. **File Writing**: The sample resume is then written to a file named `resume.json` using `writeFile` from the `fs/promises` module.\n\n5. **Completion Message**: After successfully writing the file, a message is logged to the console indicating that the sample resume has been created and is ready for editing.\n\nThis sequence ensures that a sample resume is created and saved as `resume.json` in the current directory."}
{"instruction":"Detail the process `resumed` follows for the `validate` command, particularly how it handles both successful validation and validation errors.","input":"","output":"The `validate` command in `resumed` follows this process:\n\n1. **Command Execution**: The `validate` command is executed via the CLI, with an optional filename argument. If no filename is provided, it defaults to `resume.json`.\n\n2. **File Reading**: The specified resume file is read using `readFile` from the `node:fs/promises` module.\n\n3. **Validation**: The content of the file is parsed as JSON and passed to the `validate` function from the `@jsonresume/schema` module. This function is promisified using `promisify` from `node:util`.\n\n4. **Handling Successful Validation**:\n   - If the resume is valid, a success message is logged: `\"Your [filename] looks amazing! ✨\"`.\n\n5. **Handling Validation Errors**:\n   - If validation errors occur, they are caught and logged. Each error message is displayed with its corresponding path in the JSON structure.\n   - The process exits with a failure code (`process.exitCode = 1`).\n\n6. **Error Handling**:\n   - If an error is thrown that is not an array (unexpected error), it is rethrown.\n\nThis process ensures that the resume is checked against the JSON Resume schema, and any issues are clearly communicated to the user."}
{"instruction":"What is the precise order of checks `resumed render` uses to determine the theme name?","input":"","output":"The precise order of checks `resumed render` uses to determine the theme name is as follows:\n\n1. It first checks if a theme is specified via the `--theme` option.\n2. If no theme is specified via the `--theme` option, it checks the `.meta.theme` field of the resume.\n\nIf neither is provided, it outputs an error message asking the user to specify a theme."}
{"instruction":"What happens immediately after `resumed render` fails to determine a theme name, either from the command line or the `.meta.theme` field?","input":"","output":"If `resumed render` fails to determine a theme name, either from the command line or the `.meta.theme` field, it logs an error message to the console:\n\n```\nNo theme to use. Please specify one via the --theme option or the .meta.theme field of your resume.\n```\n\nThen, it sets the process exit code to 1, indicating a failure."}
{"instruction":"Describe the mechanism `resumed render` uses to load the theme module and the error handling involved.","input":"","output":"The `resumed render` command uses the following mechanism to load the theme module and handle errors:\n\n1. **Theme Resolution**:\n   - The theme is specified either via the `--theme` option or the `.meta.theme` field in the resume JSON.\n   - If no theme is specified, an error message is logged, and the process exits with a failure code.\n\n2. **Loading the Theme**:\n   - The theme module is dynamically imported using `await import(themeName)`.\n   - If the import fails (e.g., the theme is not installed), an error message is logged indicating the theme could not be loaded, and the process exits with a failure code.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - If no theme is specified, the error message is: \"No theme to use. Please specify one via the --theme option or the .meta.theme field of your resume.\"\n   - If the theme cannot be loaded, the error message is: \"Could not load theme [themeName]. Is it installed?\"\n\nThis mechanism ensures that the user is informed of any issues related to theme loading and provides guidance on how to resolve them."}
{"instruction":"Which specific function within the `resumed` codebase calls the theme's rendering logic, and what function within the *theme* actually generates the HTML?","input":"","output":"The specific function within the `resumed` codebase that calls the theme's rendering logic is the `render` function in `resumed/src/render.ts`. This function calls the `render` method of the theme.\n\nWithin the theme, the function that actually generates the HTML is the `render` function exported by the theme module, as seen in the example `resumed/examples/with-local-theme/theme/index.js`."}
{"instruction":"How does `resumed` handle potential comments within the `resume.json` file before processing it?","input":"","output":"The `resumed` codebase uses the `strip-json-comments` package to handle potential comments within the `resume.json` file. In the `src/cli.ts` file, when reading the resume file, it applies `stripJsonComments` to remove any comments before parsing the JSON:\n\n```ts\nconst resume = JSON.parse(\n  stripJsonComments(await readFile(filename, \"utf-8\"))\n);\n```"}
{"instruction":"Under what specific circumstances will the `resumed` CLI process exit with a non-zero exit code (specifically, exit code 1)?","input":"","output":"The `resumed` CLI process will exit with a non-zero exit code (specifically, exit code 1) under the following circumstances:\n\n1. **Render Command:**\n   - If no theme is specified via the `--theme` option or the `.meta.theme` field of the resume, the CLI will output an error message and exit with code 1.\n   - If the specified theme cannot be loaded (e.g., it is not installed), the CLI will output an error message and exit with code 1.\n\n2. **Validate Command:**\n   - If validation errors are found in the resume, the CLI will list the errors and exit with code 1."}

{"instruction":"How is the `@jsonresume/schema` package utilized by `resumed`?","input":"","output":"The `@jsonresume/schema` package is used in `resumed` for two main purposes:\n\n1. **Sample Resume Initialization**: In `src/init.ts`, the package is used to import a sample resume JSON to create a sample resume file. This is done using the `require` function to load `@jsonresume/schema/sample.resume.json`.\n\n2. **Resume Validation**: In `src/validate.ts`, the package provides a `validate` function that is used to validate the structure of a resume JSON file. The `validate` function is promisified and called to ensure the resume adheres to the expected schema."}
{"instruction":"What is the purpose of using `yoctocolors` in `resumed/src/cli.ts`?","input":"","output":"The `yoctocolors` package is used in `resumed/src/cli.ts` to colorize console output. Specifically, it is used to apply colors to text in error and informational messages, such as using `red` for errors and `yellow` for highlighting options or fields in the console output."}
{"instruction":"If I provide both a `--theme` option and have a `.meta.theme` field in my `resume.json`, which theme will `resumed render` actually use?","input":"","output":"The `resumed render` command will use the theme specified by the `--theme` option if both the `--theme` option and the `.meta.theme` field in your `resume.json` are provided. The `--theme` option takes precedence."}
{"instruction":"Besides the main commands, what other built-in command-line flags does `resumed` support based on the `sade` setup?","input":"","output":"Based on the `sade` setup in the code, `resumed` supports the following built-in command-line flags:\n\n- `-v`, `--version`: Displays the current version.\n- `-h`, `--help`: Displays the help message."}

{"instruction":"What is the default output filename for the `resumed render` command, and how can it be changed?","input":"","output":"The default output filename for the `resumed render` command is `resume.html`. It can be changed using the `-o` or `--output` option followed by the desired filename."}
{"instruction":"Does the `resumed` CLI interact with the network during its core operations (excluding theme installation)?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not provide information about network interactions during the core operations of the `resumed` CLI."}
{"instruction":"How does the `resumed` CLI signal success or failure to scripts or automated processes that might call it?","input":"","output":"The `resumed` CLI signals success or failure using the process exit code. If a command completes successfully, it exits with a success code (implicitly `0`). If there is an error, such as failing to load a theme or validation errors, it sets `process.exitCode` to `1` to indicate failure."}
{"instruction":"Explain the purpose of the `try...catch` block specifically within the `validate` action in `cli.ts`.","input":"","output":"The `try...catch` block within the `validate` action in `cli.ts` is used to handle errors that may occur during the validation of a resume file. Here's the purpose of each part:\n\n- **`try` block**: It attempts to validate the resume file by calling the `validate` function. If the validation is successful, it logs a success message.\n\n- **`catch` block**: If an error occurs during validation, it checks if the error is an array (which would contain validation errors). If it is, it logs each error message and sets the process exit code to 1, indicating failure. If the error is not an array, it rethrows the error.\n\nThis structure ensures that validation errors are handled gracefully and provides feedback to the user about what went wrong."}
{"instruction":"What mechanism does `resumed/src/validate.ts` use to handle the asynchronous, callback-based nature of the original `@jsonresume/schema` validator?","input":"","output":"The `resumed/src/validate.ts` file uses the `promisify` function from Node.js's `util` module to convert the callback-based `@jsonresume/schema` validator into a promise-based function. This allows the code to handle asynchronous operations using async/await syntax."}
{"instruction":"Could `resumed` work if the input `resume.json` file was located in a different directory?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not specify handling for `resume.json` files located in different directories."}
{"instruction":"Does the `resumed render` process modify the input `resume.json` file?","input":"","output":"No, the `resumed render` process does not modify the input `resume.json` file. It reads the file to render the resume but does not alter it."}
{"instruction":"What are the direct dependencies used by the core CLI logic in `cli.ts`?","input":"","output":"The direct dependencies used by the core CLI logic in `cli.ts` are:\n\n1. `node:fs/promises`\n2. `sade`\n3. `strip-json-comments`\n4. `yoctocolors`\n5. `./index.js` (which includes `init`, `render`, and `validate` functions)"}
{"instruction":"How does `resumed` ensure it uses the correct name and version for its help messages and version flag?","input":"","output":"`resumed` uses the `sade` library to create its CLI. It reads the package name and version from the `package.json` file using the `readFile` function. This information is then passed to `sade` to set up the CLI with the correct name and version. The relevant code is in `resumed/src/cli.ts`:\n\n```ts\nconst pkgPath = \"../package.json\";\nconst pkg = JSON.parse(\n  await readFile(new URL(pkgPath, import.meta.url), \"utf-8\")\n);\n\nexport const cli = sade(pkg.name).version(pkg.version);\n```"}
{"instruction":"If the `validate` command encounters an error that is *not* an array (e.g., a file reading error before validation), how does `cli.ts` handle it?","input":"","output":"If the `validate` command encounters an error that is not an array, `cli.ts` rethrows the error. This is evident from the following part of the code in `cli.ts`:\n\n```ts\ntry {\n  await validate(filename);\n  console.log(`Your ${yellow(filename)} looks amazing! ✨`);\n} catch (err) {\n  if (!Array.isArray(err)) {\n    throw err;\n  }\n  // Handle array errors\n}\n```\n\nIf the error is not an array, it is rethrown, allowing it to propagate up the call stack."}
{"instruction":"Describe the data flow for the `render` command, from filename input to HTML output.","input":"","output":"The data flow for the `render` command in the `resumed` codebase is as follows:\n\n1. **Command Invocation**: The user invokes the `render` command via the CLI, optionally specifying a filename, output, and theme.\n\n2. **CLI Handling**: The `cli.ts` file uses the `sade` library to parse the command and options. The `render` command is set up with options for `output` and `theme`.\n\n3. **File Reading**: The specified resume file (default `resume.json`) is read using `readFile` from the `node:fs/promises` module. Comments are stripped from the JSON using `stripJsonComments`.\n\n4. **Theme Resolution**: The theme is determined either from the `--theme` option or the `.meta.theme` field in the resume JSON. If no theme is specified, an error is logged, and the process exits.\n\n5. **Theme Import**: The specified theme module is dynamically imported. If the theme cannot be loaded, an error is logged, and the process exits.\n\n6. **Rendering**: The `render` function from `render.ts` is called with the resume object and the theme module. The theme's `render` method is invoked to generate the HTML.\n\n7. **File Writing**: The rendered HTML is written to the specified output file (default `resume.html`) using `writeFile`.\n\n8. **Completion Message**: A success message is logged, indicating where the rendered resume can be found."}
{"instruction":"Is the theme's `render` function expected to be synchronous or asynchronous?","input":"","output":"The theme's `render` function can be either synchronous or asynchronous. The `render` function in `resumed/src/render.ts` is defined to handle both:\n\n```ts\ntype Theme<T> = {\n  render: (resume: object) => T | Promise<T>;\n};\n\nexport const render = (resume: object, theme: Theme<string>) =>\n  theme.render(resume);\n```\n\nThis indicates that the `render` function can return a string directly or a Promise that resolves to a string."}
{"instruction":"How does the `resumed` CLI determine which specific function to run when I type a command like `resumed init`?","input":"","output":"The `resumed` CLI uses the `sade` library to define commands and their associated actions. When you type a command like `resumed init`, the CLI determines which function to run based on the command definitions in `src/cli.ts`.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- The `sade` instance is created with the package name and version.\n- Commands are defined using the `.command()` method, where each command is associated with a description and an action.\n- For the `init` command, the action is defined as:\n\n  ```ts\n  cli\n    .command(\"init [filename]\", \"Create sample resume\", { alias: \"create\" })\n    .action(async (filename: string = \"resume.json\") => {\n      await init(filename);\n      console.log(\n        `Done!

{"instruction":"What is the purpose of reading `package.json` at the start of `src/cli.ts`?","input":"","output":"The purpose of reading `package.json` at the start of `src/cli.ts` is to access the package's name and version. This information is used to set up the CLI tool with the correct name and version using the `sade` library."}
{"instruction":"What default filename will `resumed init` use if I don't specify one?","input":"","output":"The default filename used by `resumed init` if you don't specify one is `resume.json`."}
{"instruction":"Can I name my sample resume file something other than `resume.json` using the `init` command?","input":"","output":"Yes, you can name your sample resume file something other than `resume.json` using the `init` command. You can specify a custom filename as an argument to the command, like this:\n\n```sh\nresumed init custom.json\n```"}
{"instruction":"What is the source of the content that `resumed init` writes into the new file?","input":"","output":"The content that `resumed init` writes into the new file is sourced from `@jsonresume/schema/sample.resume.json`."}
{"instruction":"What Node.js module is used by `resumed init` to write the file to disk?","input":"","output":"The `resumed init` command uses the `writeFile` function from the `node:fs/promises` module to write the file to disk."}
{"instruction":"Will `resumed validate` check a file named `cv.json` automatically?","input":"","output":"No, `resumed validate` will not automatically check a file named `cv.json`. By default, it checks `resume.json`. You would need to specify `cv.json` explicitly by running `resumed validate cv.json`."}
{"instruction":"How does `resumed validate` interact with the official JSON Resume standard?","input":"","output":"The `resumed validate` command uses the official JSON Resume schema to validate resumes. It reads the resume file, parses it, and then uses the `validate` function from the `@jsonresume/schema` package to check if the resume adheres to the JSON Resume standard. If the resume is valid, it logs a success message; otherwise, it lists the validation errors."}
{"instruction":"What will I see in my terminal if `resumed validate` finds errors in my `resume.json`?","input":"","output":"If `resumed validate` finds errors in your `resume.json`, you will see a message in your terminal like this:\n\n```\nUh-oh! The following errors were found in resume.json:\n\n ❌ [error message 1] at [error path 1].\n ❌ [error message 2] at [error path 2].\n ...\n```\n\nThe specific error messages and paths will depend on the issues found in your `resume.json`. The process will also exit with a failure code."}
{"instruction":"If `resumed validate` finds multiple errors, will it show all of them?","input":"","output":"Yes, if `resumed validate` finds multiple errors, it will list all of them and exit with a failure code. The errors are displayed with their messages and paths."}
{"instruction":"What is the significance of the `process.exitCode = 1` line in the `validate` command's error handling?","input":"","output":"The line `process.exitCode = 1` in the `validate` command's error handling is used to indicate that the process should exit with a failure code. This is typically done to signal that an error occurred during the execution of the command, which can be useful for scripts or other automated processes that rely on the exit code to determine if a command was successful or not."}
{"instruction":"Which command is executed if I just type `resumed` without any command name?","input":"","output":"The `render` command is executed by default if you type `resumed` without any command name."}
{"instruction":"What is the purpose of the `export` alias for the `render` command?","input":"","output":"The `export` alias for the `render` command allows users to use the command `resumed export` as an alternative to `resumed render`. Both commands perform the same function, which is to render a resume."}
{"instruction":"How do I tell `resumed render` to save the output as `index.html` instead of `resume.html`?","input":"","output":"You can use the `-o` or `--output` option with the `resumed render` command to specify the output filename. For example:\n\n```sh\nresumed render --output index.html\n```\n\nThis will save the output as `index.html` instead of the default `resume.html`."}
{"instruction":"Explain the exact precedence between the `--theme` option and the `.meta.theme` field for the `render` command.","input":"","output":"The `--theme` option takes precedence over the `.meta.theme` field for the `render` command. If the `--theme` option is specified, it will be used. If not, the `.meta.theme` field in the resume will be checked and used if available. If neither is provided, an error will be displayed asking the user to specify a theme."}
{"instruction":"What specific error message appears if I run `resumed render` without a theme specified either way?","input":"","output":"The specific error message that appears if you run `resumed render` without a theme specified is:\n\n```\nNo theme to use. Please specify one via the --theme option or the .meta.theme field of your resume.\n```"}
{"instruction":"How does `resumed render` attempt to load the specified theme?","input":"","output":"The `resumed render` command attempts to load the specified theme by using dynamic import. It checks if a theme is specified via the `--theme` option or the `.meta.theme` field in the resume. If a theme is specified, it tries to import the theme module using `await import(themeName)`. If the import fails, it logs an error message indicating that the theme could not be loaded and asks if it is installed."}
{"instruction":"What happens if the theme I specified with `--theme` is not installed in my project?","input":"","output":"If the theme specified with `--theme` is not installed in your project, the code will output an error message: \n\n\"Could not load theme [themeName]. Is it installed?\"\n\nThe process will then exit with a failure code."}
{"instruction":"Does `resumed render` care if the theme's render function is synchronous or asynchronous?","input":"","output":"Yes, `resumed render` supports both synchronous and asynchronous theme render functions. The `render` function in `resumed/src/render.ts` is designed to handle both:\n\n```ts\ntype Theme<T> = {\n  render: (resume: object) => T | Promise<T>;\n};\n\nexport const render = (resume: object, theme: Theme<string>) =>\n  theme.render(resume);\n```\n\nThis allows the theme's `render` function to return either a string directly or a promise that resolves to a string."}
{"instruction":"What part of the `resumed` tool is actually responsible for creating the HTML output?","input":"","output":"The part of the `resumed` tool responsible for creating the HTML output is the `render` function in `resumed/src/render.ts`. This function takes a resume object and a theme, and it calls the `render` method of the theme to generate the HTML."}
{"instruction":"Can I include comments in my `resume.json` file?","input":"","output":"Yes, you can include comments in your `resume.json` file. The code uses `strip-json-comments` to handle JSON files with comments."}
{"instruction":"Which specific Node.js function does `resumed render` use to save the generated HTML?","input":"","output":"The `resumed render` command uses the `writeFile` function from the `node:fs/promises` module to save the generated HTML."}
{"instruction":"How can I find out which version of `resumed` I have installed?","input":"","output":"You can find out which version of `resumed` you have installed by using the command:\n\n```shell\nresumed --version\n```\n\nor\n\n```shell\nresumed -v\n```"}
{"instruction":"How do I see all available commands and options for `resumed`?","input":"","output":"You can see all available commands and options for `resumed` by running the following command in your console:\n\n```shell\nresumed --help\n```\n\nThis will display the usage, available commands, and options. For more detailed information on a specific command, you can use the `--help` flag with that command, like so:\n\n```shell\nresumed render --help\nresumed init --help\n```"}
{"instruction":"What does the `resume-schema.d.ts` file do?","input":"","output":"The `resume-schema.d.ts` file declares a module for `@jsonresume/schema`. It provides TypeScript type definitions for the `validate` function and the `schema` object. The `validate` function takes a resume JSON object and a callback, which receives an array of errors or a boolean result. The `schema` is declared as an object."}
{"instruction":"Why does `resumed/src/validate.ts` use `promisify`?","input":"","output":"The `promisify` function is used in `resumed/src/validate.ts` to convert the callback-based `validate` function from the `@jsonresume/schema` module into a promise-based function. This allows the `validate` function to be used with `async/await` syntax, making the code cleaner and easier to work with."}
{"instruction":"What is the role of `resumed/src/render.ts` in the overall rendering process?","input":"","output":"The role of `resumed/src/render.ts` in the overall rendering process is to define a function that takes a resume object and a theme, and then uses the theme's `render` method to generate a rendered output. The function supports both synchronous and asynchronous rendering by returning the result of the theme's `render` method, which can be a string or a promise that resolves to a string."}
{"instruction":"If my theme's `render` function throws an error during execution, how will `resumed` handle it?","input":"","output":"The codebase does not explicitly handle errors thrown by the theme's `render` function. If an error occurs during the execution of the `render` function, it will likely propagate up and cause the process to terminate unless you handle it externally."}
{"instruction":"Can I use a theme that is not published on npm, but exists locally?","input":"","output":"Yes, you can use a local theme. The codebase includes an example of using a local theme in the `examples/with-local-theme` directory. You can specify the local theme in your `package.json` using the `file:` prefix, as shown in the example."}
{"instruction":"What does the `private: true` field in the example `package.json` files signify?","input":"","output":"I don't know."}
{"instruction":"What does `type: module` in the example `package.json` files enable?","input":"","output":"I don't know."}
{"instruction":"How would I modify `resumed` to change the default output filename globally?","input":"","output":"The codebase does not provide a direct way to change the default output filename globally. You would need to modify the `resumed/src/cli.ts` file where the default output filename is set in the `render` command options:\n\n```ts\n.option(\"-o, --output\", \"Output filename\", \"resume.html\")\n```\n\nYou can change `\"resume.html\"` to your desired default filename."}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to pipe JSON data directly into `resumed render` instead of using a file?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not mention the ability to pipe JSON data directly into `resumed render` instead of using a file."}
{"instruction":"What library provides the colored output (e.g., yellow filenames, red error markers) in the console?","input":"","output":"The library used for colored output in the console is `yoctocolors`."}
{"instruction":"Does `resumed init` overwrite an existing `resume.json` file without warning?","input":"","output":"The codebase does not specify whether `resumed init` overwrites an existing `resume.json` file without warning."}
{"instruction":"If the `validate` command succeeds, what is the exact message printed?","input":"","output":"If the `validate` command succeeds, the exact message printed is:\n\n```\n\"Your resume.json looks amazing! ✨\"\n```"}
{"instruction":"Where in the source code is the default value for the `--output` option set?","input":"","output":"The default value for the `--output` option is set in the `resumed/src/cli.ts` file. Specifically, it is set to `\"resume.html\"` in the following code:\n\n```ts\n.option(\"-o, --output\", \"Output filename\", \"resume.html\")\n```"}
{"instruction":"What does the test file `test/cli.test.ts` primarily focus on testing?","input":"","output":"The test file `test/cli.test.ts` primarily focuses on testing the command-line interface (CLI) of the `resumed` package. It verifies the behavior of the `init`, `render`, and `validate` commands, including handling of default and custom filenames, theme specification, error handling, and output messages."}
{"instruction":"How are external dependencies like `fs/promises` and internal functions like `init` handled during testing in `cli.test.ts`?","input":"","output":"In `cli.test.ts`, external dependencies like `fs/promises` and internal functions like `init` are handled using mocking with the `vi` object from the `vitest` testing framework.\n\n### External Dependencies\n\n- **`fs/promises`:** This module is mocked using `vi.mock`. The `readFile` and `writeFile` functions are specifically mocked to control their behavior during tests. For example, `readFile` is mocked to return specific JSON data, and `writeFile` is mocked to track its calls without actually writing files.\n\n### Internal Functions\n\n- **`init`:** The `init` function is mocked using `vi.mock` to track its calls and control its behavior. This allows the test to verify that `init` is called with the correct arguments without executing its actual implementation.\n\nMocking these dependencies allows the tests to focus on the logic within the `cli` commands without relying on the actual file system or the full implementation of internal functions."}
{"instruction":"What is the purpose of the `strip-json-comments` dependency?","input":"","output":"The `strip-json-comments` dependency is used in the `resumed/src/cli.ts` file to remove comments from JSON files before parsing them. This allows the tool to handle JSON files that include comments, which are not officially supported in JSON."}
{"instruction":"Can `resumed` render a resume if the theme requires fetching external resources like fonts or images?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not provide information about handling themes that require fetching external resources like fonts or images."}
{"instruction":"What was the primary motivation for creating `resumed` when `resume-cli` already existed?","input":"","output":"The primary motivation for creating `resumed` was to provide a lightweight, modern alternative to `resume-cli`. `resume-cli` had a broad scope and an aging codebase, making it increasingly harder to maintain. `Resumed` is a complete reimplementation using modern technologies, focusing on being small and efficient while dropping certain features to remain focused."}
{"instruction":"What core design principles does `resumed` follow, according to its documentation?","input":"","output":"According to the documentation, the core design principles of `resumed` include:\n\n1. **Lightweight and Focused**: It is a lightweight JSON Resume builder with a small codebase (~120 LOC) and a focus on essential features.\n\n2. **Modern Technologies**: It uses modern technologies, such as being a pure ESM package and providing TypeScript typings.\n\n3. **Modularity**: It does not install any themes by default, allowing users to pick and install their own themes.\n\n4. **Simplicity and Clarity**: The tool is designed to be a no-frills alternative to `resume-cli`, dropping certain features to remain small and focused.\n\n5. **Async Support**: It supports asynchronous rendering.\n\n6. **Comprehensive Testing**: It has 100% code coverage, ensuring reliability.\n\n7. **Node.js API**: It provides a fully-tested, strongly-typed Node.js API for programmatic use.\n\n8. **Extensibility**: Users can combine it with other tools for additional features, such as PDF generation with Puppeteer."}
{"instruction":"List the specific features found in `resume-cli` that are explicitly mentioned as *not* being part of `resumed`.","input":"","output":"The specific features found in `resume-cli` that are explicitly mentioned as *not* being part of `resumed` are:\n\n1. PDF export\n2. Local previews\n3. YAML format support"}
{"instruction":"Does `resumed` have a built-in command to automatically open the rendered HTML in a web browser?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not mention a built-in command to automatically open the rendered HTML in a web browser."}
{"instruction":"Can I validate my resume data *programmatically* using the Node.js API before rendering it?","input":"","output":"Yes, you can validate your resume data programmatically using the Node.js API before rendering it. You can use the `validate` function from the `resumed` package to achieve this. Here's a basic example:\n\n```js\nimport { validate } from 'resumed';\n\ntry {\n  await validate('resume.json');\n  console.log('Your resume is valid!');\n} catch (errors) {\n  console.error('Validation errors:', errors);\n}\n```\n\nThis will check your resume data against the JSON Resume schema and log any validation errors."}
{"instruction":"When using the `resumed` Node.js API, do I have to read the resume from a file, or can I pass a JavaScript object directly?","input":"","output":"The codebase shows that you can pass a JavaScript object directly to the `render` function when using the `resumed` Node.js API. The `render` function in `resumed/src/render.ts` takes a resume object and a theme as arguments:\n\n```ts\nexport const render = (resume: object, theme: Theme<string>) =>\n  theme.render(resume);\n```\n\nThis indicates that you can pass a JavaScript object directly without needing to read it from a file."}
{"instruction":"What advantage does `resumed` gain by supporting asynchronous theme rendering?","input":"","output":"The codebase documentation mentions that `resumed` supports async render, which allows for non-blocking operations during the rendering process. This can be advantageous when dealing with themes that require asynchronous operations, such as fetching data or performing I/O tasks, without blocking the main execution thread. This can lead to improved performance and responsiveness, especially in environments where asynchronous operations are common."}
{"instruction":"What is likely to happen if the `resumed` CLI executable tries to run but cannot find or read its own `package.json` file?","input":"","output":"The `resumed` CLI executable reads its own `package.json` file to get the package name and version using the following code:\n\n```ts\nconst pkgPath = \"../package.json\";\nconst pkg = JSON.parse(\n  await readFile(new URL(pkgPath, import.meta.url), \"utf-8\")\n);\n```\n\nIf it cannot find or read the `package.json` file, it will likely throw an error when attempting to parse the file, as the `readFile` operation will fail. This would prevent the CLI from executing properly, as it relies on this information to set up the command-line interface with the correct version and name."}
{"instruction":"What are the essential requirements for a JavaScript module to function as a theme for `resumed`?","input":"","output":"To function as a theme for `resumed`, a JavaScript module must export a `render` function. This function should take a resume object as an argument and return a string or a Promise that resolves to a string. This string typically represents the rendered HTML of the resume. \n\nHere's a basic example of what the theme module should look like:\n\n```js\nexports.render = (resume) => {\n  // Return a string or a Promise that resolves to a string\n};\n```"}
{"instruction":"What specific aspect of theme usage does the `with-local-theme` example demonstrate?","input":"","output":"The `with-local-theme` example demonstrates how to use Resumed with a local theme. It shows how to set up and render a resume using a theme that is defined and stored locally within the project directory."}
{"instruction":"What is the key takeaway from the `with-node-api` example provided with `resumed`?","input":"","output":"The key takeaway from the `with-node-api` example is how to use the `resumed` package with its Node.js API to programmatically create and render a resume. The example demonstrates reading a resume from a JSON file, rendering it using a specified theme, and writing the output to an HTML file."}
{"instruction":"What limitation of `resumed` does the `with-pdf-export` example address, and what external tool does it use?","input":"","output":"The `with-pdf-export` example addresses the limitation of `resumed` not having built-in PDF export functionality. It uses the external tool [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to export a resume to PDF."}
{"instruction":"What evidence in the source code suggests a specific build tool might be used for `resumed`?","input":"","output":"I don't know."}
{"instruction":"The README mentions 100% code coverage. Does this mean `resumed` has no bugs?","input":"","output":"I don't know. Code coverage indicates that all lines of code are executed during tests, but it doesn't guarantee the absence of bugs."}
{"instruction":"If I have an idea for a new feature for `resumed`, how should I propose it?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase doesn't provide information on how to propose new features for `resumed`."}
{"instruction":"Are there any security implications I should be aware of when using an unknown theme with `resumed render --theme some-random-theme`?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not provide information about security implications when using an unknown theme with `resumed render --theme some-random-theme`."}
{"instruction":"How would a developer typically add a new command, for example `resumed preview`, to this CLI?","input":"","output":"The codebase does not provide specific instructions on adding a new command to the CLI. However, you can look at how existing commands are implemented in `resumed/src/cli.ts` for guidance."}
{"instruction":"Does the `resumed` CLI maintain any configuration files or remember settings between uses?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not mention maintaining configuration files or remembering settings between uses."}
{"instruction":"Can I use `resumed` if my project doesn't have a `package.json` file?","input":"","output":"The codebase does not provide information on whether `resumed` can be used without a `package.json` file."}
{"instruction":"What is the expected structure of the `resume` object passed to a theme's `render` function?","input":"","output":"The expected structure of the `resume` object passed to a theme's `render` function is based on the JSON Resume schema. The `resume` object should include a `basics` section with fields like `name`, `label`, `summary`, `location`, `email`, `phone`, `url`, and `profiles`. The `basics` section is used in the local theme example to render the HTML content.\n\nFor example, in the local theme example:\n\n```js\nexports.render = ({ basics }) => `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>${basics.name}</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>${basics.name}</h1>\n    <h2>${basics.label}</h2>\n    <p>${basics.summary}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>${basics.location.city} ${basics.location.countryCode}</li>\n      <li><a href=\"mailto:${basics.email}\">${basics.email}</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"tel:${basics.phone}\">${basics.phone}</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"${basics.url}\">${basics.url}</a></li>\n      ${basics.profiles\n        .map((profile) => `<li>${profile.username} (${profile.network})</li>`)\n        .join(\"\")}\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n`;\n```\n\nThis indicates that the `resume` object should have a `basics` object with these fields to be used by the theme's `render` function."}
{"instruction":"Does `resumed` provide any utilities for manipulating the resume JSON data itself?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not mention any utilities for manipulating the resume JSON data itself."}
{"instruction":"What commands does the Resumed CLI expose, and what are their options?","input":"","output":"The Resumed CLI exposes the following commands:\n\n### `render` (default)\n\nRender resume.\n\n**Usage:** `resumed render [filename] [options]`\n\n**Aliases:** `export`\n\n**Options:**\n\n- `-o`, `--output`: Output filename (default `resume.html`)\n- `-t`, `--theme`: Theme to use\n- `-h`, `--help`: Display help message\n\n### `init`\n\nCreate sample resume.\n\n**Usage:** `resumed init [filename] [options]`\n\n**Aliases:** `create`\n\n**Options:**\n\n- `-h`, `--help`: Display help message\n\n### `validate`\n\nValidate resume.\n\n**Usage:** `resumed validate [filename] [options]`\n\n**Options:**\n\n- `-h`, `--help`: Display help message"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'render' command resolve which theme to use?","input":"","output":"The `render` command resolves which theme to use by checking the following:\n\n1. **Command Line Option**: It first looks for the `--theme` option provided in the command line.\n\n2. **Resume Metadata**: If the `--theme` option is not provided, it checks the `.meta.theme` field in the resume JSON file.\n\nIf neither is specified, it outputs an error message asking the user to define a theme via the `--theme` option or the `.meta.theme` field."}
{"instruction":"What happens if the theme specified via --theme or .meta.theme cannot be loaded?","input":"","output":"If the theme specified via `--theme` or `.meta.theme` cannot be loaded, the program will output an error message: \n\n\"Could not load theme [themeName]. Is it installed?\"\n\nThe process will then exit with a failure code."}
{"instruction":"How does Resumed differentiate between CLI usage and Node.js API usage?","input":"","output":"Resumed differentiates between CLI usage and Node.js API usage through its structure and the way commands are defined and executed.\n\n1. **CLI Usage**: \n   - The CLI is implemented using the `sade` library in `src/cli.ts`.\n   - Commands like `render`, `init`, and `validate` are defined with specific options and actions.\n   - The CLI is invoked through command-line commands, and options are passed as arguments.\n\n2. **Node.js API Usage**:\n   - The API is exposed through the `src/index.ts` file, which exports functions like `init`, `render`, and `validate`.\n   - These functions can be imported and used programmatically in Node.js applications, allowing for more flexible and integrated usage within code.\n\nThe CLI provides a user-friendly interface for command-line operations, while the Node.js API allows for programmatic control and integration into other applications."}

{"instruction":"How does Resumed test for full coverage across CLI, API, and file operations?","input":"","output":"The `resumed` codebase achieves full test coverage across CLI, API, and file operations using the following approach:\n\n1. **Test Files**: The `test` directory contains test files for each major component:\n   - `cli.test.ts`: Tests the CLI commands (`init`, `render`, `validate`) and their options.\n   - `init.test.ts`: Tests the initialization of a sample resume.\n   - `render.test.ts`: Tests the rendering functionality with themes.\n   - `validate.test.ts`: Tests the validation of resumes against the schema.\n\n2. **Mocking**: The tests use mocking to simulate file operations and external dependencies:\n   - `node:fs/promises` is mocked to simulate reading and writing files without actual file system operations.\n   - The `render` and `validate` functions are mocked to test their integration with the CLI.\n\n3. **Assertions**: The tests use assertions to verify expected outcomes:\n   - They check that functions are called with the correct arguments.\n   - They verify the output messages and error handling.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Tests include scenarios for both successful operations and error conditions, ensuring robust coverage.\n\n5. **Snapshots**: Some tests use snapshot testing to verify console output and error messages.\n\nThis comprehensive testing strategy ensures that all aspects of the CLI, API, and file operations are covered."}
{"instruction":"What is the default output filename for rendering a resume?","input":"","output":"The default output filename for rendering a resume is `resume.html`."}
{"instruction":"Can the output filename be changed, and if so, how?","input":"","output":"Yes, the output filename can be changed using the `-o` or `--output` option with the `render` command. For example:\n\n```shell\nresumed render --output custom-output.html\n```\n\nThis will render the resume to `custom-output.html` instead of the default `resume.html`."}
{"instruction":"How does Resumed ensure users don't accidentally render without specifying a theme?","input":"","output":"Resumed ensures users don't accidentally render without specifying a theme by checking if a theme is provided either via the `--theme` option or the `.meta.theme` field in the resume. If no theme is specified, it logs an error message prompting the user to define a theme and exits with a failure code. This is handled in the `render` command within the `cli.ts` file."}
{"instruction":"What happens if you pass a resume with commented-out JSON in `render`?","input":"","output":"The `render` command in the `resumed` codebase can handle JSON with comments. It uses the `strip-json-comments` package to remove comments from the JSON before parsing it. This means that if you pass a resume with commented-out JSON, the comments will be stripped out, and the JSON will be parsed correctly for rendering."}
{"instruction":"How would Resumed behave if a circular reference existed in the resume JSON?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not provide information on how Resumed handles circular references in the resume JSON."}
{"instruction":"How does Resumed differ from `resume-cli` in terms of versioning and modularity?","input":"","output":"I don't know."}
{"instruction":"Which assumptions are made about the environment (Node version, module system, etc.)?","input":"","output":"The codebase makes the following assumptions about the environment:\n\n1. **Node Version**: The use of ES modules (`import` and `export` syntax) and features like `import.meta.url` suggest that a relatively recent version of Node.js is required, as these are not supported in older versions.\n\n2. **Module System**: The project is a pure ESM (ECMAScript Module) package, as indicated in the `README.md` and the use of `\"type\": \"module\"` in `package.json` files.\n\n3. **File System Promises**: The use of `fs/promises` indicates reliance on the promise-based file system API, which is available in Node.js 10.0.0 and later.\n\n4. **Async/Await**: The code uses `async/await`, which is supported in Node.js 8.0.0 and later, but combined with other features, a more recent version is likely assumed.\n\n5. **Package Management**: The use of `npm` for installation and script execution suggests that npm is the assumed package manager.\n\n6. **JSON Import**: The use of `createRequire` to import JSON files indicates that native JSON module support is not assumed, which is consistent with the ESM approach.\n\nThese assumptions are based on the code and documentation provided."}
{"instruction":"What is the effect of `createRequire(import.meta.url)` in `init.ts`?","input":"","output":"The `createRequire(import.meta.url)` function in `init.ts` is used to create a CommonJS `require` function in an ES module context. This allows the code to import JSON files, which is not directly supported in ES modules. In this case, it's used to import the sample resume JSON from `@jsonresume/schema/sample.resume.json`."}
{"instruction":"How is the theme dynamically imported, and what are the implications of that?","input":"","output":"The theme is dynamically imported in the `resumed/src/cli.ts` file using the `import()` function. This is done within the `render` command action:\n\n```ts\nlet themeModule;\ntry {\n    themeModule = await import(themeName);\n} catch {\n    console.error(\n        `Could not load theme ${yellow(themeName)}. Is it installed?`\n    );\n\n    process.exitCode = 1;\n    return;\n}\n```\n\n### Implications of Dynamic Import:\n\n1. **Asynchronous Loading**: The theme is loaded asynchronously, which means it doesn't block the execution of the program while waiting for the module to be loaded. This can improve performance, especially if the theme module is large or if there are network delays.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: The code includes a `try-catch` block to handle errors that may occur if the theme cannot be loaded. This allows the program to provide a meaningful error message and exit gracefully if the theme is not installed or cannot be found.\n\n3. **Flexibility**: Dynamic imports allow users to specify different themes at runtime, providing flexibility to switch themes without modifying the codebase.\n\n4. **Code Splitting**: By using dynamic imports, only the necessary theme module is loaded, which can reduce the initial load time and memory usage of the application.\n\n5. **Dependency Management**: Users must ensure that the specified theme is installed and available in the environment where the code is executed. If not, the import will fail, and the program will exit with an error message."}
{"instruction":"How are test mocks created using `vitest`, and which modules are mocked?","input":"","output":"In the codebase, test mocks are created using `vitest` by using the `vi.mock` function. The modules that are mocked in the tests are:\n\n1. `node:fs/promises` - This module is mocked in multiple test files to mock the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions.\n\n2. `../src` - This module is mocked in `resumed/test/cli.test.ts`.\n\nThese mocks are used to simulate the behavior of these modules during testing without actually performing file operations."}
{"instruction":"What kind of data is validated in `validate.test.ts`, and what are the failure cases?","input":"","output":"In `validate.test.ts`, the data being validated is a JSON object representing a resume. The test checks for the following:\n\n1. **Valid Resume:**\n   - The resume contains a `basics` object with a `name` property that is a string. This is considered valid.\n\n2. **Failure Case:**\n   - The resume contains a `basics` object with a `name` property that is not a string (e.g., a number). This results in a validation failure with an error message indicating that `instance.basics.name` is not of a type(s) string."}
{"instruction":"How could Resumed be used in a CI pipeline to validate resumes for job board submissions?","input":"","output":"The codebase does not provide specific instructions or examples for using Resumed in a CI pipeline to validate resumes for job board submissions. You might need to explore setting up a CI pipeline with a tool like GitHub Actions or another CI service and use the `resumed validate` command as part of the pipeline script. However, the codebase itself does not contain this information."}
{"instruction":"What are the trade-offs of not bundling a default theme with the CLI?","input":"","output":"The codebase documentation mentions that not bundling a default theme with the CLI allows the release cycle of the CLI to be independent of the theme. This approach also encourages users to pick and install a theme themselves, providing more flexibility and reducing the package size. However, it may require more effort from users to set up initially, as they need to choose and install a theme separately."}
{"instruction":"How could you write a new theme for Resumed from scratch?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not provide specific instructions on writing a new theme for Resumed from scratch."}
{"instruction":"Which examples demonstrate PDF generation, and what tools do they use?","input":"","output":"The example that demonstrates PDF generation is `with-pdf-export`. It uses the tool [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to export a resume to PDF."}
{"instruction":"How does Resumed separate concerns between schema validation, rendering, and CLI logic?","input":"","output":"Resumed separates concerns between schema validation, rendering, and CLI logic through distinct modules and files:\n\n1. **Schema Validation**:\n   - The `validate.ts` file handles schema validation. It uses the `@jsonresume/schema` package to validate the resume JSON. The validation logic is encapsulated in the `validate` function, which reads the resume file and checks it against the schema.\n\n2. **Rendering**:\n   - The `render.ts` file is responsible for rendering the resume. It defines a `render` function that takes a resume object and a theme, then calls the theme's `render` method to produce the output.\n\n3. **CLI Logic**:\n   - The `cli.ts` file manages the command-line interface. It uses the `sade` library to define commands like `render`, `init`, and `validate`. Each command has its own action handler that coordinates the necessary operations, such as reading files, invoking the render or validate functions, and handling output.\n\nBy organizing these functionalities into separate files and functions, Resumed maintains a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to manage and extend."}
{"instruction":"How would you extend Resumed to support JSON Resume v1.1 schema?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not provide information on extending Resumed to support JSON Resume v1.1 schema."}
{"instruction":"Could a micro-model built for Resumed predict how to fix resume validation errors?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase for Resumed does not include any functionality or information about building or using a micro-model to predict how to fix resume validation errors."}
{"instruction":"How much of Resumed’s logic is pure vs side-effectful (e.g., I/O, file writes)?","input":"","output":"I don't know."}
{"instruction":"What minimal context is needed to correctly use Resumed from a Node.js script?","input":"","output":"To use Resumed from a Node.js script, you need the following minimal context:\n\n1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have `resumed` and a JSON Resume theme installed. For example:\n   ```sh\n   npm install resumed jsonresume-theme-even\n   ```\n\n2. **Import Required Modules**: Import the necessary modules in your script:\n   ```js\n   import { promises as fs } from 'fs';\n   import * as theme from 'jsonresume-theme-even';\n   import { render } from 'resumed';\n   ```\n\n3. **Read and Parse Resume JSON**: Read and parse your resume JSON file:\n   ```js\n   const resume = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile('resume.json', 'utf-8'));\n   ```\n\n4. **Render the Resume**: Use the `render` function from Resumed with the resume data and theme:\n   ```js\n   const html = await render(resume, theme);\n   ```\n\n5. **Output the Rendered HTML**: Write the rendered HTML to a file:\n   ```js\n   await fs.writeFile('resume.html', html);\n   ```\n\nThis setup will allow you to render a resume using Resumed in a Node.js environment."}
{"instruction":"If the resume file contains invalid Unicode, what would be the failure path in the CLI?","input":"","output":"The codebase does not explicitly handle invalid Unicode in the resume file. If the resume file contains invalid Unicode, the failure would likely occur during the `readFile` operation in the `render`, `init`, or `validate` commands. This would result in an error when attempting to parse the JSON content with `JSON.parse`. The error would not be specifically caught, so it would likely cause the process to exit with an error message related to JSON parsing."}
{"instruction":"How could an agent use Resumed to generate resumes from a GraphQL resume builder frontend?","input":"","output":"I'm sorry, but the codebase does not provide information on integrating Resumed with a GraphQL resume builder frontend."}
{"instruction":"Is Resumed capable of running in Deno, and what changes would be required if not?","input":"","output":"I don't know. The codebase does not mention Deno or provide any information about compatibility with it."}
{"instruction":"What is the smallest set of files necessary to render a resume with a custom theme?","input":"","output":"To render a resume with a custom theme, the smallest set of files necessary would be:\n\n1. **`src/cli.ts`**: Contains the command-line interface logic for rendering.\n2. **`src/index.ts`**: Exports the necessary functions for rendering.\n3. **`src/render.ts`**: Contains the logic to render a resume using a theme.\n4. **`src/init.ts`**: (Optional) If you need to create a sample resume.\n5. **A custom theme file**: This would be your custom theme's JavaScript file that exports a `render` function.\n\nYou would also need a JSON resume file (e.g., `resume.json`) and a package.json file to manage dependencies, including your custom theme."}
{"instruction":"What is Resumed?","input":"","output":"Resumed is a lightweight JSON Resume builder, serving as a no-frills alternative to resume-cli. It is a small, pure ESM package that provides a CLI and Node.js API, TypeScript typings, and async render support. It focuses on creating, validating, and rendering resumes programmatically."}
{"instruction":"How do I install Resumed?","input":"","output":"You can install Resumed using npm with the following command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install resumed jsonresume-theme-even # or your theme of choice\n```"}
{"instruction":"What commands does Resumed support?","input":"","output":"Resumed supports the following commands:\n\n1. **render** (default)\n   - Aliases: `export`\n   - Options:\n     - `-o`, `--output`: Output filename (default `resume.html`)\n     - `-t`, `--theme`: Theme to use\n     - `-h`, `--help`: Display help message\n\n2. **init**\n   - Aliases: `create`\n   - Options:\n     - `-h`, `--help`: Display help message\n\n3. **validate**\n   - Options:\n     - `-h`, `--help`: Display help message"}
{"instruction":"How do I render a resume with a custom theme?","input":"","output":"To render a resume with a custom theme using the `resumed` package, you can use the `render` command with the `--theme` option. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Ensure your custom theme is installed or available locally.\n2. Use the `render` command with the `--theme` option to specify your custom theme.\n\n**Example Command:**\n\n```sh\nresumed render --theme your-custom-theme\n```\n\nReplace `your-custom-theme` with the name of your custom theme. If your theme is defined in the `.meta.theme` field of your resume, you can omit the `--theme` option."}
