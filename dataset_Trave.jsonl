{"instruction": "What are the main differences between `resumed` and the original `resume-cli`?", "input": "", "output": "`resumed` is a reimplementation focusing on being lightweight and modern (Pure ESM, smaller codebase). Key differences include: `resumed` requires explicit theme installation/specification (no default theme), lacks built-in PDF export, local preview server, and YAML support, but offers a Node.js API and has better test coverage."}
{"instruction": "Can `resumed` export my resume to PDF format directly?", "input": "", "output": "No, `resumed` does not have a built-in PDF export feature. However, the documentation provides an example (`examples/with-pdf-export`) showing how you can achieve this by using the `resumed` Node.js API to render the HTML, and then using a library like Puppeteer to convert the generated HTML to a PDF."}
{"instruction": "How do I specify which theme to use for rendering?", "input": "", "output": "You can specify the theme in two ways: 1. Using the command-line option `-t` or `--theme` followed by the theme package name (e.g., `resumed render --theme jsonresume-theme-even`). 2. Adding a `theme` property inside a `meta` object in your `resume.json` file (e.g., `\"meta\": { \"theme\": \"jsonresume-theme-even\" }`). The command-line option takes precedence if both are specified."}
{"instruction": "Describe how to use `resumed` with a local theme.", "input": "Context: `resumed/examples/with-local-theme`", "output": "You can use a local theme by installing it as a local dependency in your `package.json` (e.g., `\"dependencies\": { \"jsonresume-theme-local\": \"file:./theme\" }`) and then specifying the theme name (matching the dependency name) with the `--theme` option: `resumed --theme jsonresume-theme-local`. The local theme directory should contain at least an `index.js` file that exports a `render` function and a basic `package.json`."}
{"instruction": "Explain the purpose of the `examples/with-node-api` directory.", "input": "Context: `resumed/examples/with-node-api`", "output": "The `examples/with-node-api` directory demonstrates how to use `resumed` programmatically within a Node.js script, rather than using the command-line interface. It shows importing the `render` function from `resumed` and a theme package (`jsonresume-theme-even`), reading the `resume.json` file, and calling `render` to generate the HTML output, which is then written to a file (`resume.html`)."}
{"instruction": "What functionality is provided by `src/validate.ts`?", "input": "Context: `resumed/src/validate.ts`", "output": "The `src/validate.ts` file exports an async function `validate` that takes a filename as input. It reads the content of the file, parses it as JSON, and then uses the official `@jsonresume/schema` package's `validate` function to check if the JSON data conforms to the JSON Resume schema. It returns a promise that resolves if valid or rejects with an array of errors if invalid."}
{"instruction": "What does the test file `test/cli.test.ts` verify?", "input": "Context: `resumed/test/cli.test.ts`", "output": "The `test/cli.test.ts` file contains unit tests for the command-line interface logic defined in `src/cli.ts`. It tests the behavior of the `init`, `render`, and `validate` commands, including handling default arguments, custom filenames, options like `--theme` and `--output`, theme resolution (via option or `.meta.theme`), parsing resumes with comments, error handling for missing themes or invalid themes, and checking console output messages and exit codes."}
{"instruction": "My resume has comments in it (like // comment). Can `resumed render` handle this?", "input": "Context: `resumed/src/cli.ts` and `resumed/test/cli.test.ts`", "output": "Yes, `resumed render` can handle JSON files with comments. The `cli.ts` file uses the `strip-json-comments` library before parsing the JSON, so comments will be removed and won't cause parsing errors during the render process."}
{"instruction": "I ran `resumed render` without specifying a theme and got an error. Why?", "input": "Error message: `No theme to use. Please specify one via the --theme option or the .meta.theme field of your resume.`", "output": "This error occurs because `resumed` requires a theme to render the resume, but it couldn't find one specified. You need to either add the `--theme <theme-name>` option to your command or add a `meta: { \"theme\": \"<theme-name>\" }` field to your `resume.json` file. Make sure the theme you specify is also installed."}
{"instruction": "What is the alias for the `resumed render` command?", "input": "Context: `resumed/src/cli.ts`", "output": "The alias for the `resumed render` command is `export`."}
{"instruction": "What is the alias for the `resumed init` command?", "input": "Context: `resumed/src/cli.ts`", "output": "The alias for the `resumed init` command is `create`."}
{"instruction": "Where does the `resumed init` command get the sample resume content from?", "input": "Context: `resumed/src/init.ts`", "output": "The `resumed init` command requires the `sample.resume.json` file from the `@jsonresume/schema` package using Node.js's `createRequire` mechanism, as native ESM JSON imports are not standard yet. It then writes this sample content to the specified output file."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the features of `resumed` listed in the main README.", "input": "Context: `resumed/README.md`", "output": "`resumed` is highlighted for being small (~120 LOC), a Pure ESM package, offering both a CLI and Node.js API, providing TypeScript typings, supporting asynchronous theme rendering, and having 100% test coverage."}
{"instruction": "What is `resumed`?", "input": "", "output": "`resumed` is a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) tool and Node.js library designed to build resumes from data following the JSON Resume standard. It's presented as a modern, focused alternative to `resume-cli`."}
{"instruction": "How do I install `resumed` and a necessary theme like 'jsonresume-theme-even'?", "input": "", "output": "Use npm: `npm install resumed jsonresume-theme-even`. Remember that `resumed` requires you to install a theme separately; it doesn't come with a default one."}
{"instruction": "List all the primary commands available in the `resumed` CLI.", "input": "", "output": "The primary commands are `render` (or `export`), `init` (or `create`), and `validate`. You can get help on any command using the `--help` flag (e.g., `resumed render --help`)."}
{"instruction": "What does the `resumed init` command do?", "input": "", "output": "The `resumed init` command creates a sample `resume.json` file in your current directory (or a specified filename). This file is based on the official JSON Resume schema's sample and serves as a starting template."}
{"instruction": "Explain the purpose of the `resumed render` command.", "input": "", "output": "The `resumed render` command takes a `resume.json` file and uses a specified JSON Resume theme to generate an HTML representation of the resume. By default, it reads `resume.json` and writes to `resume.html`."}
{"instruction": "How do I specify the theme for the `resumed render` command?", "input": "", "output": "You must specify a theme either using the command-line option `-t <theme-name>` or `--theme <theme-name>`, or by adding a `meta: { \"theme\": \"<theme-name>\" }` field within your `resume.json` file. The theme package must be installed separately."}
{"instruction": "What is the function of the `resumed validate` command?", "input": "", "output": "The `resumed validate` command checks if your `resume.json` file (or a specified file) adheres to the official JSON Resume schema. It reports success or lists any validation errors found."}
{"instruction": "What is the default input filename for `resumed render` and `resumed validate`?", "input": "", "output": "The default input filename for both `render` and `validate` commands is `resume.json` in the current working directory."}
{"instruction": "What is the default output filename for `resumed render`?", "input": "", "output": "The default output filename for the `render` command is `resume.html`."}
{"instruction": "How can I change the output filename when rendering?", "input": "", "output": "Use the `-o` or `--output` option followed by the desired filename, for example: `resumed render --theme <theme-name> -o my-custom-resume.html`."}
{"instruction": "Compare `resumed` with `resume-cli`.", "input": "", "output": "`resumed` is a smaller, modern (Pure ESM) reimplementation of `resume-cli`. It lacks features like a default theme, built-in PDF export, YAML support, and a local preview server found in `resume-cli`. However, `resumed` offers a Node.js API, explicit theme handling, and focuses on the core tasks of initializing, validating, and rendering JSON Resumes to HTML."}
{"instruction": "Does `resumed` support exporting resumes to PDF?", "input": "", "output": "No, `resumed` does not have built-in PDF export functionality. To generate a PDF, you need to use `resumed` to render the HTML first (either via CLI or Node.js API) and then use a separate tool like Puppeteer to convert the HTML file to PDF. The project provides an example for this (`examples/with-pdf-export`)."}
{"instruction": "Can I use comments in my `resume.json` file?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, `resumed` uses `strip-json-comments` before parsing the resume file, so you can include JavaScript-style comments (e.g., `// This is a comment`) in your `resume.json` without causing errors during processing."}
{"instruction": "How does `resumed` handle themes? Does it install them automatically?", "input": "", "output": "`resumed` does not install themes automatically. You must install your chosen theme using a package manager like npm (e.g., `npm install jsonresume-theme-even`). You then tell `resumed` which theme to use via the `--theme` option or the `.meta.theme` field in your resume file."}
{"instruction": "Explain how to use `resumed` with a local theme directory.", "input": "Context: `examples/with-local-theme`", "output": "To use a local theme, first set it up as a local Node.js package (with at least `package.json` and `index.js` exporting a `render` function). Then, install it as a file dependency in your project's `package.json` (e.g., `\"dependencies\": { \"my-local-theme\": \"file:./path/to/theme\" }`). Finally, run `resumed render --theme my-local-theme`."}
{"instruction": "Describe how to use the `resumed` Node.js API.", "input": "Context: `examples/with-node-api`", "output": "You can use `resumed` programmatically by importing its functions. For rendering, import `render` from `resumed` and your chosen theme module. Read and parse your `resume.json` data, then call `await render(resumeObject, themeModule)`. This returns the rendered HTML string. Similar programmatic access might be possible for `init` and `validate` by importing them from `./index.js`."}
{"instruction": "What should I do if I get the error 'Could not load theme <theme-name>. Is it installed?'", "input": "Error: `Could not load theme my-awesome-theme. Is it installed?`", "output": "This error indicates `resumed` couldn't find or import the specified theme. Check these things: 1. Did you install the theme using npm (`npm install my-awesome-theme`)? 2. Is the theme name spelled correctly in your command (`--theme my-awesome-theme`) or in your `resume.json`'s `.meta.theme` field? 3. If it's a local theme, is the path correct and the package set up properly?"}
{"instruction": "What does a validation error message from `resumed validate` typically look like?", "input": "Context: `test/cli.test.ts`", "output": "Validation errors are usually presented as a list, indicating the problem and the location within the JSON structure. For example: `❌ instance.basics.name is not of a type(s) string at basics.name.`"}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the `sade` package used in `src/cli.ts`?", "input": "Context: `src/cli.ts`", "output": "`sade` is a lightweight library used to create the command-line interface structure for `resumed`. It helps define commands (`render`, `init`, `validate`), their aliases, options (`--theme`, `--output`), and parse command-line arguments."}
{"instruction": "Why might `resumed` be considered 'lightweight'?", "input": "Context: `README.md`", "output": "`resumed` is considered lightweight primarily due to its small codebase size (around 120 lines of code mentioned in the README) and focused feature set, omitting features like built-in PDF export or a preview server found in its predecessor, `resume-cli`."}
{"instruction": "Where can I find examples of how to use `resumed`?", "input": "", "output": "The `resumed` project includes an `examples` directory containing subdirectories that demonstrate usage with a standard JSON Resume theme, a local theme, the Node.js API, and how to implement PDF export using Puppeteer."}

{"instruction": "Describe the initial steps the `resumed` CLI takes when it's launched, before processing any specific command.", "input": "", "output": "When launched, the `resumed` CLI's entry point (using `src/cli.ts`) first imports necessary Node.js modules, external libraries (`sade`, `strip-json-comments`, `yoctocolors`), and internal functions. It then dynamically reads its own `package.json` to determine its name and version. Finally, it instantiates the `sade` command-line parser with this name and version, preparing it to define and parse commands."}
{"instruction": "What library is responsible for parsing the command-line arguments like commands (render, init, validate) and options (--theme, --output) in `resumed`, and how does it work?", "input": "", "output": "The `sade` library is responsible for parsing command-line arguments. `resumed` defines its commands, aliases, and options using `sade`'s API (e.g., `cli.command(...)`, `.option(...)`). When the user runs `resumed`, `sade` analyzes `process.argv` to identify the specific command invoked and the values provided for its arguments and options, then executes the corresponding `.action()` function defined for that command."}
{"instruction": "Explain the complete sequence of actions performed by `resumed` when executing the `resumed init` command with no filename specified.", "input": "", "output": "1. `sade` parses the command as `init` with the default filename `resume.json`. 2. The `init` action in `cli.ts` is triggered. 3. It calls the internal `init('resume.json')` function from `src/init.ts`. 4. `src/init.ts` uses `require` (via `createRequire`) to load `sample.resume.json` from `@jsonresume/schema`, then uses `fs.promises.writeFile` to save this content, formatted, into `resume.json`. 5. The action prints a success message ('Done! Start editing resume.json...') to the console. 6. The process exits successfully (code 0)."}
{"instruction": "Detail the process `resumed` follows for the `validate` command, particularly how it handles both successful validation and validation errors.", "input": "", "output": "1. `sade` identifies the `validate` command and the target filename (defaulting to `resume.json`). 2. The `validate` action in `cli.ts` executes within a `try...catch`. 3. It calls `await validate(filename)` from `src/validate.ts`. 4. `src/validate.ts` reads the file, parses its JSON content, and calls the promisified `@jsonresume/schema.validate`. 5. **If valid:** The promise resolves, the `try` block completes, and a success message ('Your [filename] looks amazing! ✨') is logged. The process exits with code 0. 6. **If invalid:** The promise rejects with an error array. The `catch` block executes, confirms the error is an array, logs an introductory error message, iterates through the array logging each error's message and path using `yoctocolors`, sets `process.exitCode = 1`, and the process exits with code 1."}
{"instruction": "What is the precise order of checks `resumed render` uses to determine the theme name?", "input": "", "output": "The `render` command determines the theme name (`themeName`) in this specific order: 1. It first checks if a theme was provided via the command-line option `-t` or `--theme`. If yes, that value is used. 2. If the command-line option was *not* used, it then inspects the parsed `resume` object for a property at `.meta.theme`. If found, that value is used. 3. If neither the option is present nor the `.meta.theme` field exists, theme determination fails."}
{"instruction": "What happens immediately after `resumed render` fails to determine a theme name, either from the command line or the `.meta.theme` field?", "input": "", "output": "If `themeName` remains undefined after checking both sources, the `render` action immediately prints an error message to `stderr` ('No theme to use. Please specify one via the --theme option or the .meta.theme field of your resume.') using `yoctocolors`, sets `process.exitCode = 1`, and terminates the command's execution without attempting to render."}
{"instruction": "Describe the mechanism `resumed render` uses to load the theme module and the error handling involved.", "input": "", "output": "After identifying the `themeName`, `resumed render` uses a dynamic `import(themeName)` statement within a `try...catch` block. The `import()` asynchronously attempts to load the Node.js module corresponding to `themeName`. If successful, the loaded module is stored. If the `import()` fails (e.g., theme not installed, invalid module), the `catch` block executes, printing an error message ('Could not load theme [themeName]. Is it installed?') to `stderr`, setting `process.exitCode = 1`, and terminating the command."}
{"instruction": "Which specific function within the `resumed` codebase calls the theme's rendering logic, and what function within the *theme* actually generates the HTML?", "input": "", "output": "The `render` function exported by `resumed/src/render.ts` is called from the CLI action. This function, in turn, calls the `render` function *exported by the dynamically loaded theme module* (e.g., `themeModule.render(resume)`). It's the theme's own `render` function that is responsible for generating the final HTML output string."}
{"instruction": "How does `resumed` handle potential comments within the `resume.json` file before processing it?", "input": "", "output": "Before attempting to parse the content of the `resume.json` file (in both `render` and `validate` commands), the CLI reads the file content as a string and passes it through the `strip-json-comments` library. This removes any JavaScript-style comments (like `//` or `/* */`), ensuring that `JSON.parse()` receives a valid JSON string."}
{"instruction": "Under what specific circumstances will the `resumed` CLI process exit with a non-zero exit code (specifically, exit code 1)?", "input": "", "output": "The `resumed` CLI will set `process.exitCode = 1` and exit with a non-zero status in the following cases: 1. During `resumed render` if no theme can be determined (neither `--theme` option nor `.meta.theme` field is present). 2. During `resumed render` if the determined theme module fails to load via dynamic `import()`. 3. During `resumed validate` if the resume file fails validation against the JSON Resume schema."}
{"instruction": "Which source file is the main orchestrator for the `resumed` CLI, defining commands and coordinating actions?", "input": "", "output": "The file `resumed/src/cli.ts` is the main orchestrator. It uses the `sade` library to define the `render`, `init`, and `validate` commands, parse arguments/options, and contains the primary `.action()` logic that calls helper functions and controls the workflow for each command."}
{"instruction": "Explain the role of `resumed/src/index.ts`.", "input": "", "output": "The file `resumed/src/index.ts` serves as the main entry point for the module's functionality. It re-exports the key functions (`cli`, `init`, `render`, `validate`) from their respective implementation files (`cli.ts`, `init.ts`, `render.ts`, `validate.ts`). This allows the CLI binary and potential programmatic users (via Node.js API) to import functionality from a single point."}
{"instruction": "How is the `@jsonresume/schema` package utilized by `resumed`?", "input": "", "output": "The `@jsonresume/schema` package is used in two ways: 1. The `resumed init` command loads the `sample.resume.json` file from this package to create a new sample resume. 2. The `resumed validate` command uses the `validate` function exported by this package (after promisifying it) to check if a given resume object conforms to the official JSON Resume schema."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of using `yoctocolors` in `resumed/src/cli.ts`?", "input": "", "output": "`yoctocolors` is a lightweight library used to add color to the text output printed to the console (stdout and stderr). `resumed` uses it to highlight parts of success messages (like filenames in yellow) and error messages (like error prefixes in red) for better readability."}
{"instruction": "If I provide both a `--theme` option and have a `.meta.theme` field in my `resume.json`, which theme will `resumed render` actually use?", "input": "", "output": "The theme specified via the `--theme` command-line option will take precedence and be used for rendering. The `.meta.theme` field in the `resume.json` file will be ignored in this case."}
{"instruction": "Besides the main commands, what other built-in command-line flags does `resumed` support based on the `sade` setup?", "input": "", "output": "Based on the standard `sade` setup and the code (`.version(pkg.version)`), `resumed` automatically supports `-v` or `--version` (to display the installed version number read from `package.json`) and `-h` or `--help` (to display help messages for the main command or subcommands)."}
{"instruction": "What default input filename is assumed by `resumed render` and `resumed validate` if none is specified?", "input": "", "output": "If no filename argument is provided on the command line, both `resumed render` and `resumed validate` default to using `resume.json` as the input file in the current directory."}
{"instruction": "What is the default output filename for the `resumed render` command, and how can it be changed?", "input": "", "output": "The default output filename for `resumed render` is `resume.html` in the current directory. It can be changed using the `-o` or `--output` option followed by the desired filename, e.g., `resumed render --output my-cv.html`."}
{"instruction": "Does the `resumed` CLI interact with the network during its core operations (excluding theme installation)?", "input": "", "output": "During its core operations (`init`, `validate`, `render` with a locally available theme), `resumed` primarily performs local file system operations and processing. It does not inherently require network access, *unless* the dynamically imported theme itself performs network operations within its `render` function, which is uncommon for standard themes."}
{"instruction": "How does the `resumed` CLI signal success or failure to scripts or automated processes that might call it?", "input": "", "output": "It signals success or failure primarily through its exit code. A successful execution results in an exit code of `0`. An error condition (like failed validation, missing/unloadable theme) results in `process.exitCode` being set to `1`, leading to a non-zero exit code, which shell scripts and other processes can check."}
{"instruction": "Explain the purpose of the `try...catch` block specifically within the `validate` action in `cli.ts`.", "input": "", "output": "The `try...catch` block in the `validate` action exists to handle the outcome of the asynchronous `validate(filename)` call. The `try` part executes the validation and logs success if the promise resolves. The `catch` part executes if the promise rejects (meaning validation failed), allowing the CLI to gracefully catch the validation errors array, format them clearly for the user using `console.error`, and set the appropriate non-zero exit code (`process.exitCode = 1`)."}
{"instruction": "What mechanism does `resumed/src/validate.ts` use to handle the asynchronous, callback-based nature of the original `@jsonresume/schema` validator?", "input": "", "output": "It uses the `promisify` utility from Node.js's built-in `util` module. `promisify(schema.validate)` converts the original `schema.validate` function, which expects a callback, into a new function that returns a Promise, making it compatible with `async/await` syntax used in the rest of the CLI actions."}
{"instruction": "Could `resumed` work if the input `resume.json` file was located in a different directory?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you can provide a relative or absolute path as the filename argument to the `render` or `validate` commands, for example: `resumed render ../data/my-resume.json` or `resumed validate /Users/me/Documents/resume.json`."}
{"instruction": "Does the `resumed render` process modify the input `resume.json` file?", "input": "", "output": "No, the `resumed render` command only reads the input `resume.json` file. It does not modify the original file; it only uses the data to generate a separate output HTML file."}
{"instruction": "What are the direct dependencies used by the core CLI logic in `cli.ts`?", "input": "", "output": "The direct dependencies explicitly imported and used in `cli.ts` are `readFile`, `writeFile` (from `node:fs/promises`), `sade`, `strip-json-comments`, `yoctocolors`, and the internal functions `init`, `render`, `validate` (from `./index.js`)."}
{"instruction": "How does `resumed` ensure it uses the correct name and version for its help messages and version flag?", "input": "", "output": "At startup, `cli.ts` programmatically reads its own `package.json` file using `fs.promises.readFile` and `JSON.parse`. The `name` and `version` properties from this parsed object are then passed to the `sade` instance (`sade(pkg.name).version(pkg.version)`), ensuring the CLI automatically uses the details defined in its package manifest."}
{"instruction": "If the `validate` command encounters an error that is *not* an array (e.g., a file reading error before validation), how does `cli.ts` handle it?", "input": "", "output": "The `catch` block in the `validate` action specifically checks `if (!Array.isArray(err))`. If the caught error is not an array (which is the expected format for schema validation errors), it re-throws the error (`throw err;`). This lets Node.js handle the unexpected error further up the chain, likely terminating the process and printing the error stack trace."}
{"instruction": "Describe the data flow for the `render` command, from filename input to HTML output.", "input": "", "output": "1. Filename (e.g., `resume.json`) provided or defaulted. 2. `--theme` option or `.meta.theme` determines `themeName`. 3. `readFile` gets file content string. 4. `stripJsonComments` cleans the string. 5. `JSON.parse` creates the `resume` object. 6. Dynamic `import(themeName)` loads the `themeModule`. 7. Internal `render(resume, themeModule)` calls `themeModule.render(resume)`. 8. Theme returns HTML string (`rendered`). 9. `writeFile` saves the `rendered` string to the output file (e.g., `resume.html`)."}
{"instruction": "Is the theme's `render` function expected to be synchronous or asynchronous?", "input": "", "output": "`resumed` handles both. The internal `render` function signature definition (`src/render.ts`) suggests themes can return `T | Promise<T>`. The call within `cli.ts` uses `await render(...)`, meaning it correctly waits for the result whether the theme's `render` function returns the HTML string directly or returns a Promise that resolves to the string."}
{"instruction": "How does the `resumed` CLI determine which specific function to run when I type a command like `resumed init`?", "input": "I want to understand the command dispatching.", "output": "`resumed` uses the `sade` library. When you run `resumed init`, `sade` parses the arguments, recognizes `init` as a defined command, and then executes the specific asynchronous `.action()` function that was registered for the `init` command within `src/cli.ts`."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of reading `package.json` at the start of `src/cli.ts`?", "input": "Why does the CLI need its own package file info?", "output": "The CLI reads its own `package.json` primarily to get the package `name` and `version`. This information is used by `sade` to set up the CLI's identity, correctly display the version number when requested via `resumed --version`, and potentially use the name in help messages."}
{"instruction": "What default filename will `resumed init` use if I don't specify one?", "input": "I ran `resumed init` without any arguments.", "output": "If you run `resumed init` without specifying a filename, it will default to creating the sample resume file named `resume.json` in your current working directory."}
{"instruction": "Can I name my sample resume file something other than `resume.json` using the `init` command?", "input": "I prefer to use `my_cv_data.json`.", "output": "Yes, you can specify a custom filename directly after the `init` command. For example: `resumed init my_cv_data.json`."}
{"instruction": "What is the source of the content that `resumed init` writes into the new file?", "input": "Where does the sample resume data come from?", "output": "The `init` command loads its content from the `sample.resume.json` file bundled within the `@jsonresume/schema` npm package, which it accesses using Node.js's `require` mechanism."}
{"instruction": "What Node.js module is used by `resumed init` to write the file to disk?", "input": "How is the file actually created?", "output": "The `init` function, called by the `init` command action, uses the `writeFile` function from Node.js's built-in `fs/promises` module to asynchronously write the sample JSON content to the specified file path."}
{"instruction": "Will `resumed validate` check a file named `cv.json` automatically?", "input": "My resume file isn't named `resume.json`.", "output": "No, by default `resumed validate` looks for `resume.json`. To validate `cv.json`, you must explicitly provide the filename: `resumed validate cv.json`."}
{"instruction": "How does `resumed validate` interact with the official JSON Resume standard?", "input": "Is it using the official schema?", "output": "Yes, the `validate` command uses the `validate` function provided by the `@jsonresume/schema` npm package. This function checks if the structure and data types in your JSON file conform to the official JSON Resume schema definition."}
{"instruction": "What will I see in my terminal if `resumed validate` finds errors in my `resume.json`?", "input": "How are validation errors displayed?", "output": "If errors are found, `resumed validate` will print an 'Uh-oh!' message, followed by a list of specific errors. Each error typically shows a red '❌', the error message (e.g., 'is not of a type(s) string'), and the location (path) within your JSON where the error occurred (e.g., 'at basics.name'). The process will also exit with code 1."}
{"instruction": "If `resumed validate` finds multiple errors, will it show all of them?", "input": "Does validation stop after the first error?", "output": "Yes, `resumed validate` will report all validation errors found by the `@jsonresume/schema` validator. The CLI iterates through the entire array of errors returned by the validator and prints details for each one."}
{"instruction": "What is the significance of the `process.exitCode = 1` line in the `validate` command's error handling?", "input": "Why set the exit code?", "output": "Setting `process.exitCode = 1` signals to the operating system or any calling script that the command did not complete successfully. This allows automation tools or build scripts to detect that validation failed and potentially stop subsequent steps."}
{"instruction": "Which command is executed if I just type `resumed` without any command name?", "input": "I just ran `resumed`.", "output": "Running `resumed` without specifying a command name defaults to executing the `render` command, as it's defined with `{ default: true }` in `src/cli.ts`."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the `export` alias for the `render` command?", "input": "Why does `resumed export` work?", "output": "The `export` alias is provided simply as an alternative name for the `render` command. Running `resumed export` is functionally identical to running `resumed render`. Aliases can sometimes make commands feel more intuitive depending on the user's perspective."}
{"instruction": "How do I tell `resumed render` to save the output as `index.html` instead of `resume.html`?", "input": "I need a different output file name.", "output": "Use the `-o` or `--output` option followed by the desired name: `resumed render -o index.html` or `resumed render --output index.html`."}
{"instruction": "Explain the exact precedence between the `--theme` option and the `.meta.theme` field for the `render` command.", "input": "Which theme source wins if both are present?", "output": "The `--theme` command-line option has higher precedence. If you specify a theme using `--theme`, `resumed render` will use that theme, regardless of whether a `.meta.theme` field exists in your `resume.json`. The `.meta.theme` field is only used if the `--theme` option is *not* provided."}
{"instruction": "What specific error message appears if I run `resumed render` without a theme specified either way?", "input": "I forgot to add a theme.", "output": "You will see an error message similar to: 'No theme to use. Please specify one via the --theme option or the .meta.theme field of your resume.' The command will then stop, and the process will exit with code 1."}
{"instruction": "How does `resumed render` attempt to load the specified theme?", "input": "What mechanism is used for theme loading?", "output": "`resumed render` uses Node.js's dynamic `import()` function within an `async` action. It passes the determined theme name (e.g., 'jsonresume-theme-even') to `import()`, which attempts to resolve and load the corresponding Node module asynchronously."}
{"instruction": "What happens if the theme I specified with `--theme` is not installed in my project?", "input": "I misspelled the theme package name.", "output": "The dynamic `import(themeName)` call will fail. The `catch` block in the `render` action will execute, printing an error message like 'Could not load theme [themeName]. Is it installed?', setting `process.exitCode = 1`, and stopping the rendering process."}
{"instruction": "Does `resumed render` care if the theme's render function is synchronous or asynchronous?", "input": "Can themes do async work during render?", "output": "No, `resumed` handles both. It calls the theme's render function using `await render(resume, themeModule)`. This correctly handles cases where the theme's `render` function returns the HTML string directly (synchronous) or returns a Promise that resolves with the HTML string (asynchronous)."}
{"instruction": "What part of the `resumed` tool is actually responsible for creating the HTML output?", "input": "Does `resumed` itself build the HTML?", "output": "No, `resumed` itself does not build the HTML. It orchestrates the process. The actual HTML generation is done by the `render` function provided *by the theme module* you specify. `resumed` just loads the theme and calls its `render` function with your resume data."}
{"instruction": "Can I include comments in my `resume.json` file?", "input": "I want to add notes within my JSON.", "output": "Yes, you can include JavaScript-style comments (e.g., `// ...` or `/* ... */`) in your `resume.json`. The `resumed` CLI uses the `strip-json-comments` library to remove these comments before parsing the JSON data for rendering or validation."}
{"instruction": "Which specific Node.js function does `resumed render` use to save the generated HTML?", "input": "How is the output file written?", "output": "It uses the `writeFile` function from Node.js's built-in `fs/promises` module to asynchronously write the HTML string (returned by the theme) to the specified output file path."}
{"instruction": "How can I find out which version of `resumed` I have installed?", "input": "I need to check my `resumed` version.", "output": "Run the command `resumed --version` or its shorthand `resumed -v` in your terminal. This will display the installed version number."}
{"instruction": "How do I see all available commands and options for `resumed`?", "input": "I want a summary of how to use the CLI.", "output": "Run `resumed --help` or `resumed -h`. This will display the main help message listing available commands (`render`, `init`, `validate`) and global options. You can also get help for a specific command, like `resumed render --help`."}
{"instruction": "What does the `resume-schema.d.ts` file do?", "input": "What is the purpose of this `.d.ts` file?", "output": "The `resume-schema.d.ts` file provides TypeScript type definitions for the `@jsonresume/schema` package. This helps developers using `resumed` (or working on it) with type checking and autocompletion when interacting with the schema validation functions, especially if the original package lacks up-to-date types."}
{"instruction": "Why does `resumed/src/validate.ts` use `promisify`?", "input": "What's the reason for using `util.promisify`?", "output": "The original `validate` function from `@jsonresume/schema` likely uses the older Node.js callback pattern. `util.promisify` is used to wrap this function, converting it into a function that returns a Promise. This allows it to be easily used with `async/await` syntax, which is preferred in modern JavaScript/TypeScript and used throughout the `resumed` CLI actions."}
{"instruction": "What is the role of `resumed/src/render.ts` in the overall rendering process?", "input": "What does the internal `render` function do?", "output": "The `resumed/src/render.ts` file exports a simple wrapper function. Its main role is to receive the resume object and the loaded theme module from the CLI action, and then execute the theme's own `render` method, passing the resume object to it. It essentially acts as the bridge between the CLI orchestration and the theme's implementation."}
{"instruction": "If my theme's `render` function throws an error during execution, how will `resumed` handle it?", "input": "What happens if the theme code itself fails?", "output": "Since the call in `cli.ts` is `await render(resume, themeModule)` (which calls `themeModule.render`), an error thrown inside the theme's render function will propagate up. If not caught internally by the theme, it will likely cause the `resumed` CLI process to terminate and Node.js will report the unhandled error and stack trace from the theme."}
{"instruction": "Can I use a theme that is not published on npm, but exists locally?", "input": "I developed my own theme in a local folder.", "output": "Yes. While the `.meta.theme` field typically uses package names, you can use the `--theme` option with a relative path to your theme's directory (if it's structured correctly as a Node module with an entry point exporting `render`) or use `npm link` or `file:` dependencies in your `package.json` and refer to the linked name via `--theme`, similar to the `with-local-theme` example."}
{"instruction": "What does the `private: true` field in the example `package.json` files signify?", "input": "Why is `private: true` used in the examples?", "output": "Setting `\"private\": true` in a `package.json` prevents the package from being accidentally published to the npm registry. It's commonly used for example projects, local applications, or workspaces that are not intended for public distribution as standalone packages."}
{"instruction": "What does `type: module` in the example `package.json` files enable?", "input": "What is the effect of `type: module`?", "output": "`\"type\": \"module\"` instructs Node.js to treat `.js` files within that package directory as ECMAScript Modules (ESM) by default. This allows the use of `import` and `export` syntax instead of the older CommonJS `require()` and `module.exports`."}
{"instruction": "How would I modify `resumed` to change the default output filename globally?", "input": "I always want the output to be `cv.html`, not `resume.html`.", "output": "To change the *default* output filename, you would need to modify the `resumed` source code. In `src/cli.ts`, locate the definition for the `render` command's output option (`.option('-o, --output', 'Output filename', 'resume.html')`) and change the default value 'resume.html' to 'cv.html'."}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to pipe JSON data directly into `resumed render` instead of using a file?", "input": "Can I do `cat resume.json | resumed render`?", "output": "No, the `resumed` CLI as implemented in `src/cli.ts` expects a filename argument and uses `readFile` to get the resume data. It does not include logic to read from standard input (stdin), so piping data directly into it is not supported."}
{"instruction": "What library provides the colored output (e.g., yellow filenames, red error markers) in the console?", "input": "How does `resumed` color its output text?", "output": "The `resumed` CLI uses the `yoctocolors` library to add ANSI color codes to the strings printed to the console, making the output more readable."}
{"instruction": "Does `resumed init` overwrite an existing `resume.json` file without warning?", "input": "I already have a `resume.json` and ran `init` again.", "output": "Yes, based on the use of `writeFile` in `src/init.ts`, the `resumed init` command will overwrite an existing file with the same name (e.g., `resume.json`) without prompting for confirmation."}
{"instruction": "If the `validate` command succeeds, what is the exact message printed?", "input": "What does success look like for `resumed validate`?", "output": "Upon successful validation, it prints a message like: 'Your [filename] looks amazing! ✨', where `[filename]` is the name of the file that was validated (e.g., 'resume.json')."}
{"instruction": "Where in the source code is the default value for the `--output` option set?", "input": "I need to find where 'resume.html' default is defined.", "output": "The default value for the `--output` option is defined in `src/cli.ts` within the `sade` command definition for `render`: `.option('-o, --output', 'Output filename', 'resume.html')`. The third argument to `.option` sets the default."}
{"instruction": "What does the test file `test/cli.test.ts` primarily focus on testing?", "input": "What aspects of the CLI are covered by this test file?", "output": "`test/cli.test.ts` focuses on testing the command-line interface behavior. It verifies that the correct internal functions (`init`, `render`, `validate`) are called with the right arguments based on CLI input, checks that options and defaults work as expected, tests theme loading logic and error handling (like missing themes), and asserts that the correct messages are logged to the console using spies."}
{"instruction": "How are external dependencies like `fs/promises` and internal functions like `init` handled during testing in `cli.test.ts`?", "input": "How does the test isolate the CLI logic?", "output": "The test file uses `vi.mock` (from Vitest) to replace the actual `fs/promises` module and the internal functions (`init`, `render`, `validate` imported from `src/index.js`) with mock implementations. This allows the test to verify that the CLI *calls* these functions correctly without actually performing file operations or running the real rendering/validation logic."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the `strip-json-comments` dependency?", "input": "Why is `strip-json-comments` needed?", "output": "It's included because standard JSON does not support comments. This library allows users to add comments to their `resume.json` files for notes or documentation, and the CLI tool can still parse the file correctly by removing these comments before passing the string to `JSON.parse()`."}
{"instruction": "Can `resumed` render a resume if the theme requires fetching external resources like fonts or images?", "input": "My theme uses Google Fonts.", "output": "Yes, `resumed` itself just executes the theme's `render` function. If that function outputs HTML that links to external resources (like CSS files, fonts via `@import` or `<link>`, images via `<img>`), the resulting `resume.html` file will contain those links. The browser will handle fetching them when the HTML file is opened."}
